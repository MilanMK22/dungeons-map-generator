## Dungeons and Dragons Introduction
Dungeon & Dragons (D&D) is an iconic tabletop role-playing game that combines storytelling and strategy to create a rich gaming experience. Players assume the roles of heroic characters, referred to as “adventurers”, who embark on quests, battle monsters, and explore the fantastical world facilitated by the Dungeon Master (DM). The DM is responsible for the storytelling and narration, controlling both monsters and non-playable characters, and introducing obstacles for the players to conquer.

The D&D map, which serves as a formal representation of the game world, is an indispensable element of a successful and immersive game. Maps are often "dungeons", which are perilous enclosed spaces, such as underground labyrinths, haunted mansions, and complex cave systems. Dungeons are teeming with dangerous monsters and traps, and are designed to challenge adventurers with substantial risk, while offering significant rewards should the players successfully complete their quest. Furthermore, dungeons consist of multiple layers that progressively escalate in danger as they delve deeper. While the DM who facilitates the game possesses knowledge of the entire map, adventurers have limited visibility, meaning they can view only a certain radius of the dungeon. At its core, a rich map — detailed, logical, and open-ended — is a crucial tool that drives the success of the gameplay.

## 4.0 Project Management Methodology
Our group will work under an Agile project management methodology. This will involve two-week long sprints whereby each team member will work independently on an Issue. We will structure our meetings around Sprints, with each Sprint involving a Sprint Planning, Sprint Retro, and Stand-Ups.

Work items will be structured as Issues in GitLab, with code to be merged into the main branch of the repository through merge requests built off of the Issue. Each Sprint will have a To-Do of Issues to be completed, with Issues to be completed further down the line stored in a Backlog. This will all be structured on a KanBan board in GitLab.

Meetings:
- Sprint Planning (2-weekly).
- Sprint Retrospective (2-weekly).
- Stand-Ups (During Sprints as needed).
- Attend weekly meetings with client

## 5.0 Project Tools
Our group intends to employ a combination of programming languages to complete this map generator project. Java will be utilised for implementing the general algorithm and other backend requirements, while React will serve as the platform for displaying and hosting the website. Depending on the complexity of the interactions between the two languages, we may opt to code purely in React or Java. Ideally, we would host this website once the project is successfully completed. 

Our group will utilise GitLab for version control and task assignment as we have a strong proficiency with GitLab from past experiences and projects. GitLab’s scope and time management tools will help facilitate communication and collaboration within the team, and establish clear milestones that can be easily communicated with stakeholders.
