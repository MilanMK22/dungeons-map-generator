## Dungeons and Dragons Introduction
Dungeon & Dragons (D&D) is an iconic tabletop role-playing game that combines storytelling and strategy to create a rich gaming experience. Players assume the roles of heroic characters, referred to as “adventurers”, who embark on quests, battle monsters, and explore the fantastical world facilitated by the Dungeon Master (DM). The DM is responsible for the storytelling and narration, controlling both monsters and non-playable characters, and introducing obstacles for the players to conquer.

The D&D map, which serves as a formal representation of the game world, is an indispensable element of a successful and immersive game. Maps are often "dungeons", which are perilous enclosed spaces, such as underground labyrinths, haunted mansions, and complex cave systems. Dungeons are teeming with dangerous monsters and traps, and are designed to challenge adventurers with substantial risk, while offering significant rewards should the players successfully complete their quest. Furthermore, dungeons consist of multiple layers that progressively escalate in danger as they delve deeper. While the DM who facilitates the game possesses knowledge of the entire map, adventurers have limited visibility, meaning they can view only a certain radius of the dungeon. At its core, a rich map — detailed, logical, and open-ended — is a crucial tool that drives the success of the gameplay.
