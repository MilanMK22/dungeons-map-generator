### Our Game Experience
Following the stakeholder's suggestion, Group E decided to conduct a brief role-play test play of a generated map. It's worth noting that none of our team members possess prior experience with role-playing fantasy games. Consequently, our approach to conducting this trial run has been entirely informed by online research and the rule book provided by the stakeholder. This documentation serves as an informal record of the game and will be presented to the stakeholder. Its primary objective is to track our advancements as we refine the map generation process.

## Gathering the Group
We found a group of friends who were interested in this test run. This consists of all members of Group E, except one member who was out of town during this time. In total, there were five players. Our project manager was appointed the role of Keeper.

## Rulebook
We were given the Call of Cthulu (Fantasy Role Playing in the Worlds of H.P. Lovecraft) rulebook. This rulebook contains the essential rules, character creation guides, and scenarios.

## Creating Characters!
Each player created a character. Using the box of figurines supplied to us by the stakeholder, we selected unique models to represent our characters. In Call of Cthulu, the characters are typically ordinary people. However, our figurines are animals/beasts. We have decided to use our imagination for this.

We created characters by rolling the die to determine the nine basic characteristics (STR, CON, SIZ, etc.). We rolled our 3D6 dice (3 6-sided dice), and added them up to get our stats.

## Keeper
The Keeper (Hayden Riches) took on the responsibility of narrating the story (although a very brief story), describing the setting, and playing the roles of non-playable characters (NPCs). This helped us build tension and slowly reveal the map.


## Observations During Game
While the number of rooms on the map were sufficient, they lacked a context that made the game interesting and engaging. For examples, they are just empty rooms. Nothing separates them contextually from other rooms.

No doors! We couldn't get inside. Keeper made sure of that...

Lots of empty space in some areas. One investigator decided to wander around outside. No obstacles are found outside...

## Final Takeaways
As mentioned in the stakeholder meeting, we should look into adding further context and WHYS. Would make the game a lot more engaging and interesting!
