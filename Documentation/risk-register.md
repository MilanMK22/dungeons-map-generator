# Risk Register

All risks within the risk register are based on the risk matrix included below the risk table.

## Risk Table

| Risk ID | Risk Title | Description | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Rating | Mitigation Strategy | Residual Risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01 | Key Person Risk | Absense of a key person due to illnesses, or other circumstances beyond a person's control. This would affect our workflow as somebody else would need to fill in for this. | Likely | High | High | We will work in an Agile manner using Sprints so this is limited to 2-week periods. | Low |
| 02 | Changing Client Expectations | The client shifts the goalposts on our scope, requiring a large amount of re-work to meet their new expectations. | Unlikely | Very High | High | We will meet reguarly with the client to ensure we are up to date with their expecations and are actively meeting them. This will be on a weekly or near-weekly basis. | Low |
| 03 | Low Performance | Performance risk occurs when the project doesnâ€™t perform as well as initially expected. | Likely | High | High | Anticipating potential performance risks early on in the planning proces, plan your project thoroughly and promote open communication between team members. | Low |
| 04 | Client Availability | The client is unavailable for an indefinite period of time due to other circumstances. This would setback progress in any decicion-making and feedback cycle. | Unlikely | Medium | Low | Ensure that any enquiries and feedback are addressed as soon as possible and thoroughly document previous client meetings in detail to minimize confusion. | Low |
| 05 | Scope Creep | As a result of poor project management, the project scope expands beyond the initial plan and the team begins investing effort/time in low-priority tasks. This leads to increased workload, delays, and risk of missing crucial deadlines. | Low | Medium | Low | Unanimously decide and clearly outline high-priority tasks at the beginning of each sprint. | Low |
| 06 | Acts of Nature | Acts of nature (earthquakes, pandemics, et cetera) require work on the project to halt or shift online. | Very Unlikely | Very High | High | Our project is based online and allows for remote work should access to campus not be possible, likewise in such an event, it is likely that project requirements will change to mitigate this. | Medium |
| 07 | Legal Risk | Materials used on the project breach legal requirements such as licenses. | Very Unlikely | Very High | High | We will create our own resources as much as possible, and make an effort to fully understand any licenses we come across in order to stay within their requirements. | Low |
