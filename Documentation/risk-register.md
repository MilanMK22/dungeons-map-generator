| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01 | Key Person Risk | Absense of a key person due to illnesses, or other circumstances beyond a person's control. This would affect our workflow as somebody else would need to fill in for this. | Likely | High | High | We will work in an Agile manner using Sprints so this is limited to 2-week periods. | Low |
| 02 | Changing Client Expectations | The client shifts the goalposts on our scope, requiring a large amount of re-work to meet their new expectations. | Unlikely | Very High | High | We will meet reguarly with the client to ensure we are up to date with their expecations and are actively meeting them. This will be on a weekly or near-weekly basis. | Low |
| 03 | Low Performance | Performance risk occurs when the project doesnâ€™t perform as well as initially expected. | Likely | High | High | Anticipating potential performance risks early on in the planning proces, plan your project thoroughly and promote open communication between team members. | low |
| 04 | Client Availability | The client is unavailable for an indefinite period of time due to other circumstances. This would setback progress in any decicion-making and feedback cycle. | Low | Medium | Low | Ensure that any enquiries and feedback are addressed as soon as possible and thoroughly document previous client meetings in detailed to minimize confusion. | Low |
| 05 | Scope Creep | As a result of poor project management, the project scope expands beyond the initial plan and the team begins investing effort/time in low-priority tasks. This leads to increased workload, delays, and risk of missing crucial deadlines. | Low | Medium | Low | Unanimously decide and clearly outline high-priority tasks at the beginning of each sprint. | Low |
