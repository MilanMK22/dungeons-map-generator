# Sprint Retros

### Sprint 1: Acute

#### Setting the Stage
The team's first sprint, Acute, consisted of two major goals: creating and connecting the React and Java apps, and establishing skeleton code for required classes. Other minor goals (non-sprint goals) included: 
- displaying the 2D array grid on React,
- sourcing, naming, and storing all the appropriate images,
- creating a dropdown component for the React app,
- decomposing the React app into multiple components, and
- implementing a home page for the React app.


#### What Went Well
All sprint goals were achieved, and all issues within the sprint have been closed, approved, and merged. All minor goals were also achieved.

#### Challenges Faced
No major problems have been faced so far. However, the team has decided that there are not enough meetings. Moving forward, we will be holding two stand-up meetings per week.

#### Next Steps

- Progress Report
- Path Finding Algorithm
- Front End Layers
- Functionality to save grids

### Sprint 2: Binomial

#### Setting the Stage
The team's second sprint, Binomial, was focused on refining our graphics displaying, and beginning to implement path-finding to connect elements on the map. During the sprint, we were also required to submit a group progress report.

#### What Went Well
All sprint goals were achieved. The exception being path-finding is not 100% ready to be implemented, however, significant progress was made toward this. The goal on the project timeline for path-finding is the end of Week Eight.

#### Challenges Faced
No notable challenges were faced during the sprint.

#### Next Steps
- Complete path-finding.
- Complete graphics.
- Add map downloading functionality.
