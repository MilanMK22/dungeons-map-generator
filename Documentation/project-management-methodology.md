## Sprints
- During sprint planning, all issues within the scope of the sprint should be pulled into To Do. These cases have priority throughout the sprint and should be completed prior to pulling in cases from the backlog.

- Issues in To Do should not be assigned to any team members as it could block others from picking up these cases earlier.

- One issue assigned at once per member.

## Merge Requests
- All merge requests should be reviewed prior to merging.
- Merge requests should be created from an issue as this will enforce naming conventions and good practises.
